## [Project Description](#project-description)
Much of the research in the geosciences, such as projecting future changes in the environment and improving weather and flood
forecasting, is conducted using computational models that simulate the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and land surfaces. These
geoscience models are part of the full research workflow that leads to scientific discovery. There is strong agreement across
the sciences that reproducible workflows are needed. Open and reproducible workflows not only strengthen public confidence in
the sciences, but also result in more efficient community science, leading to faster time to science. However, recent efforts
to standardize data sharing and archiving guidelines within research institutions, professional societies, and academic
publishers make clear that the scientific community does not know what to do about data produced as output from the
computational models. To date, the rule for reproducibility is to "save all the data", but model data can be prohibitively
large, particularly in a field like atmospheric science. The massive size of the model outputs, as well as the large
computational cost to produce these outputs, makes this not only a problem of reproducibility, but also a "big data" problem.
To achieve open and reproducible workflows in geoscience modeling research, this project will bring together modelers
representing diverse research areas and application types, and representing modeling efforts from large to small.

Discussion across different modeling communities suggests that the answer to "what to do about model data" will look different
depending on model descriptors. Examples of important model descriptors include reproducibility, storage vs. computational
costs, and value to the community. Since the atmospheric model community is incredibly diverse, this project will organize
community workshops to tackle the problem. These workshops will involve representatives from across the geoscience modeling
spectrum, including both operations and research, and ranging across complexity and size. The ultimate goal of these workshops
is to provide model data best practices to the community, including scientific journal publishers, and funding agencies. To
achieve this goal, this team of researchers suggests to craft rubrics based on the model descriptors that will help
researchers and centers describe their model data in consistent terms so that proper decisions are made regarding archiving
and retention.

## [Steering Committee](#steering-committee)
 
### Adam Clark, NOAA/University of Oklahoma
* Dr. Clark is a Research Meteorologist at the NOAA 
and Affiliate Associate Professor in the School of Meteorology at the University of Oklahoma. 
He is one of the lead planners and facilitators for the annual NOAA/Hazardous Weather Testbed 
Spring Forecasting Experiments and his primary research interests are geared toward developing 
tools and improving forecast models used for predicting severe weather.

### Gilbert Compo, Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at the University of Colorado Boulder
* Dr. Compo is a Senior Research Scientist at CIRES who co-leads the ongoing NOAA 20th Century 
Reanalysis Project. Through his research, he has vast experience generating and working with 
umerical model generated ocean and atmospheric historical reanalysis products. 

### Laura Condon, University of Arizona, Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences
* Dr. Condon researches water sustainability and the dynamics of hydrologic systems in the context of 
past development and future climate change. Her work combines physically based numerical modeling 
with statistical techniques to evaluate complex system behavior. She is a member of the ParFlow 
development team and teaches integrated modeling courses.

### Gokhan Danabasoglu, NCAR, Climate and Global Dynamics Laboratory

Community Earth System Model (CESM) – an internationally recognized, data-intensive, 
community-developed, state-of-the-art global climate model.

### Josh Hacker, Jupiter
* Dr. Hacker is the co-founder of Earth and Ocean Systems at Jupiter.

### Michael A. Friedman, American Meteorological Society (AMS) 
* Dr. Friedman is the Acting Co-Director of Publications and Journals Production Manager within 
the American Meteorological Society (AMS). He also serves as the AMS staff liaison to the 
AMS Board on Data Stewardship, and is involved with external initiatives to develop common 
approaches and standards for data citation, storage, and stewardship among publishers, funders, 
and repositories in the earth and space sciences.

### Jared Marquis, Univeristy of North Dakota, Atmospheric Sciences
* Mr. Marquis is pursuing his PHD at UND.

### Matthew Mayernik, NCAR, Library, co-PI
* Dr. Mayernik leads NCAR initiatives on data citation, management, and policy. He is also a member 
of the AMS Board on Data Stewardship, and led an AMS initiative to write a “Data Archiving and Citation” 
recommendation that was instituted in 2015.

### Gretchen Mullendore, University of North Dakota, Atmospheric Sciences, co-PI
* Dr. Mullendore has used a range of mesoscale models throughout her research career (e.g., UW-COMMAS, WRF). 
She has used models for many different outcomes, ranging from idealized sensitivity studies to 
real-time operational forecasting. Dr. Mullendore teaches graduate-level classes in NWP and 
is a member of the Unidata Strategic Advisory Committee.

### Eliza Murillo, Univeristy of Oklahoma, School of Meteorology
