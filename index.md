## [Project Description](#project-description)
Much of the research in the geosciences, such as projecting future changes in the environment and improving weather and flood
forecasting, is conducted using computational models that simulate the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and land surfaces. These
geoscience models are part of the full research workflow that leads to scientific discovery. There is strong agreement across
the sciences that replicable workflows are needed. Open and replicable workflows not only strengthen public confidence in
the sciences, but also result in more efficient community science, leading to faster time to science. However, recent efforts
to standardize data sharing and preservation guidelines within research institutions, professional societies, and academic
publishers make clear that the scientific community does not know what to do about data produced as output from the
computational models. To date, the rule for replicability is to "preserve all the data", but model data can be prohibitively
large, particularly in a field like atmospheric science. The massive size of the model outputs, as well as the large
computational cost to produce these outputs, makes this not only a problem of replicability, but also a "big data" problem.
To achieve open and replicable workflows in geoscience modeling research, this project will bring together modelers
representing diverse research areas and application types, and representing modeling efforts from large to small.

Discussion across different modeling communities suggests that the answer to "what to do about model data" will look different
depending on model descriptors. Examples of important model descriptors include community commitment, simulation workflow accessibility, 
simulation output accessibility, research feature reproducibility, and cost of running simulation workflow vs cost of repository 
data management services. Since the atmospheric model community is incredibly diverse, this project will organize
community workshops to tackle the problem. These workshops will involve representatives from across the geoscience modeling
spectrum, including both operations and research, and ranging across complexity and size. The ultimate goal of these workshops
is to develop guidance on what data and software elements of simulation based research need 
to be preserved and shared to meet community open science expectations, including those of funders and publishers. To
achieve this goal, this team of researchers suggests to craft rubrics based on the model descriptors that will help
researchers and centers describe their model data in consistent terms so that proper decisions are made regarding preservation
and retention.
