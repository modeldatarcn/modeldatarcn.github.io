# Steering committee members 

### Adam Clark, NOAA/University of Oklahoma
Dr. Clark is a Research Meteorologist at the NOAA 
and Affiliate Associate Professor in the School of Meteorology at the University of Oklahoma. 
He is one of the lead planners and facilitators for the annual NOAA/Hazardous Weather Testbed 
Spring Forecasting Experiments and his primary research interests are geared toward developing 
tools and improving forecast models used for predicting severe weather.

### Gilbert Compo, Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at the University of Colorado Boulder
Dr. Compo is a Senior Research Scientist at CIRES who co-leads the ongoing NOAA 20th Century 
Reanalysis Project. Through his research, he has vast experience generating and working with 
umerical model generated ocean and atmospheric historical reanalysis products. 

### Laura Condon, University of Arizona, Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences
Dr. Condon researches water sustainability and the dynamics of hydrologic systems in the context of 
past development and future climate change. Her work combines physically based numerical modeling 
with statistical techniques to evaluate complex system behavior. She is a member of the ParFlow 
development team and teaches integrated modeling courses.

### Gokhan Danabasoglu, NCAR, Climate and Global Dynamics Laboratory
Dr. Danabasoglu brings extensive experience as a leader, developer, and Chief Scientist for the 
Community Earth System Model (CESM) – an internationally recognized, data-intensive, 
community-developed, state-of-the-art global climate model.

### Josh Hacker, Jupiter
Dr. Hacker is a co-founder of Jupiter Intelligence, Inc., and leads the Earth and Ocean Systems team at Jupiter.  His research has spanned numerical weather prediction, predictability and data assimilation.  His computing experience and interests span traditional HPC to public cloud platforms.

### Michael A. Friedman, American Meteorological Society (AMS) 
Dr. Friedman is the Acting Co-Director of Publications and Journals Production Manager within 
the American Meteorological Society (AMS). He also serves as the AMS staff liaison to the 
AMS Board on Data Stewardship, and is involved with external initiatives to develop common 
approaches and standards for data citation, storage, and stewardship among publishers, funders, 
and repositories in the earth and space sciences.

### Jared Marquis, Univeristy of North Dakota, Atmospheric Sciences
Mr. Marquis is a PhD student in the Department of Atmospheric Science at the University of North Dakota under Dr. Jianglong Zhang.  His research experience includes estimating impact of cirrus cloud contamination in infrared sea surface temperature retrieval using radiative transfer simulations, dust and cirrus biases in hyperspectral radiance assimilation, and various modification of radiative transfer code microphysics and solar models.  Other research interests include remote sensing, seasonal range forecasts, and mesoscale modeling.

### Matthew Mayernik, NCAR, Library, co-PI
Dr. Mayernik leads NCAR initiatives on data citation, management, and policy. He is also a member 
of the AMS Board on Data Stewardship, and led an AMS initiative to write a “Data Archiving and Citation” 
recommendation that was instituted in 2015.

### Gretchen Mullendore, University of North Dakota, Atmospheric Sciences, co-PI
Dr. Mullendore has used a range of mesoscale models throughout her research career (e.g., UW-COMMAS, WRF). 
She has used models for many different outcomes, ranging from idealized sensitivity studies to 
real-time operational forecasting. Dr. Mullendore teaches graduate-level classes in NWP and 
is a member of the Unidata Strategic Advisory Committee.

### Elisa Murillo, Univeristy of Oklahoma, School of Meteorology
Ms. Murillo is a PhD student in the School of Meteorology at the University of Oklahoma working with Dr. Cameron Homeyer. Her research interests focus on tropopause-penetrating convection, and her model experience includes a variety of science objectives, such as idealized sensitivity studies of mesoscale models and global ensemble models (e.g. CESM).

### Douglas Schuster, NCAR, Computational & Information System Laboratory, co-PI
Mr. Schuster is the manager for the Data Engineering and Curation Section at NCAR, 
which manages the NCAR Research Data Archive (RDA). He is also the current 
chair of the AMS Board on Data Stewardship.

### Gary Strand, NCAR, Climate and Global Dynamics Laboratory
Mr. Strand is the CESM Data Manager. He brings considerable experience as a software 
engineer specializing in climate model data management (archiving, access, metadata, provenance, etc.), 
data analysis and visualization, and the many issues involved with terascale and petascale data.
